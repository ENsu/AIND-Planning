* GRAPHPLAN system is introduced by _Avrim Blum, Merrick Furst 1997_, which was much faster (orders of magnitude) than other contemporary planners. It introduce a great way of using graph structure to improve the performance of AI planning. Many new graph-planning systems were developed soon afterward. A planning graph can also be used to produce useful heuristic. [_AIAMA 3rd edition_]. 

* Fast Forward is introduced by _Hoffmann 2005_, which is a forward state-space searcher that can use heuristic effectively. It helps the development of useful heuristic in AI planning. [_AIAMA 3rd edition_]. 

* PDDL is introduced by _Ghallab et al. 1998_ for defining planning problems. It has been used as the standard language for planning problems since 1998. PDDL helps to represent a planning problem in AI planning field, and easily parsed by computer. [_AIAMA 3rd edition_].
